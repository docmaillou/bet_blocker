- `themes.css` - Contains all theme definitions
- `popup.html` - Updated with theme selector
- `popup.js` - Theme loading and saving logic

- `manifest.json` - Updated to include themes.css as web accessible resource

### Storage
Themes are stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API, ensuring they sync across devices.

### Default Behavior
If no theme is selected or if there's an error loading the theme, the extension defaults to the Red & White theme.

## Customization

The theme system is designed to be easily extensible. To add new themes:

1. Add new theme option to the select dropdown in `popup.html`
2. Define theme styles in `themes.css` using the naming convention `theme-{name}`
3. Themes automatically inherit base styles and only need to override specific colors

## Support

If you experience any issues with themes:
1. Try refreshing the extension by disabling and re-enabling it
2. Check the browser console for any error messages
3. Reset to default theme by selecting "Red & White" in settings
